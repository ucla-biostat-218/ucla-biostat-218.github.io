# Syllabus -- Biostat 218 -- Observational Health Data Science and Informatics

## A. Overview

### Course Description
An introduction to observational research in the health data sciences. Topics include disease cohort characterization, patient-level prediction and population-level estimation using administrative claims and electronic health records.  Lectures will cover an introduction of observational health databases, a common data model for representing patient trajectories through healthcare systems, tools to manipulate data while preserving patient privacy, theory of patient-level prediction and casual inference from observational data, and best practices for generating reproducible and reliable observational studies.  Introductory theory will demonstrate how linear and generalized linear modeling is used in observational studies.

### Inclusivity

UCLA’s Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion provides resources, events, and information about current initiatives at UCLA to support equality for all members of the UCLA community. I hope that you will communicate with me or your TA if you experience anything in this course that does not support an inclusive environment, and you can also report any incidents you may witness or experience on campus to the Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion on their website <https://equity.ucla.edu>.

## C. Course Assignments & Exams

### Homework Assignments

Homework assignments will generally come from the exercises provided in _The Book of OHDSI_.  Each homework will include an exercise in analyzing a real public health-related problem.  Assignments will be posted on Monday and due approximately two weeks after assignment by 5PM via email (PDF).

### Data Analysis Project

Students are expected to perform an original observational health data science analysis project during this course and present their theoretical or empirical findings in a mini-seminar series (approximately 15-20 mins per student) during Finals week.
Additionally, a written report of your work (max. 10 typed pages) is due on
[add date] by 5PM via email (PDF).  Students are responsible for finding an appropriate health domain and designing their study. One page project proposals are due
[add date] by 5PM via email (PDF).  Students should plan on attending several Biostatistics (Wednesdays at 3:30PM) and Bioinformatics (Mondays at 11:00AM) department seminars to get a feeling for the appropriate format.

### Grading

Grades will be based on the homework (40%), participation (10%) and final observational health analysis project (50%).

## D. Course Policies & UCLA Policies

### Academic Integrity

**Message about Academic Integrity to All UCLA Students from UCLA Dean of Students**: UCLA is a community of scholars. In this community, all members including faculty staff and students alike are responsible for maintaining standards of academic honesty. As a student and member of the University community, you are here to get an education and are, therefore, expected to demonstrate integrity in your academic endeavors. You are evaluated on your own merits. Cheating, plagiarism, collaborative work, multiple submissions without the permission of the professor, or other kinds of academic dishonesty are considered unacceptable behavior and will result in formal disciplinary proceedings usually resulting in suspension or dismissal.

**Forms of Academic Dishonesty**: As specified in the UCLA Student Conduct Code, violations or attempted violations of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to, cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, multiple submissions or facilitating academic integrity:
• Allowing another person to take a quiz, exam, or similar evalution for you
• Using unauthorized material, information, or study aids in any academic exercise or examination – textbook, notes, formula list, calculators, etc.
• Unauthorized collaboration in providing or requesting assistance, such as sharing information
• Unauthorized use of someone else’s data in completing a computer exercise
• Altering a graded exam or assignment and requesting that I be regraded

**Plagiarism**: Presenting another’s words or ideas as if they were one’s own
• Submitting as your own through purchase or otherwise, part of or an entire work produced verbatim by someone else
• Paraphrasing ideas, data or writing without properly acknowledging the source
• Unauthorized transfer and use of someone else’s computer file as your own
• Unauthorized use of someone else’s data in completing a computer exercise

**Multiple Submissions**: Submitting the same work (with exact or similar content) in more than one class without permission from the instructor to do so. This includes courses you are currently taking, as well as courses you might take in another quarter.

**Facilitating Academic Dishonesty**: Participating in any action that compromises the integrity of the academic standards of the University; assisting another to commit an act of academic dishonesty
• Taking a quiz, exam, or similar evaluation in place of another person
• Allowing another student to copy from you
• Providing material or other information to another student with knowledge that such assistance could be used in any of the violations stated above (e.g., giving test information to students in other discussion sections of the same course)
• Altering data to support research
• Presenting results from research that was not performed
• Crediting source material that was not used for  research

While you are here at UCLA, if you are unsure whether what you are considering doing is cheating, **don’t take chances** – ask your professor. In addition, avoid placing yourself in situations which might lead your professor to **suspect you of cheating**.

**Alternatives to Academic Dishonesty**

• Seek out help – Meet with your professor, ask for assistance as needed.
• Ask for an extension – if you explain your situation to your professor, she/he might be able to grant you an extended deadline for an upcoming assignment.
•	See a counselor at Student Psychological Services, and/or your school, college or department – UCLA has many resources for students who are feeling the stresses of academic and personal pressures.
