## Real-world data are closed-world {.smaller}

For any given day:

1. If we see a record of something, it happened
2. If we don't see a record of something, it did not happen

which imples

* We must know everything that could happen for (2) to hold
* Everything we want to record must be in a reference table:
  - all drugs, conditions, procedures, devices, visits, etc
  
> Only the closed-world assumption allows analytics
>
> - Incidence (how many patients get a disease in a time-period over all patients)
>
> - Prevalence (how many patients have a disease at a time-point over all patients)
>
> - All prediction / epidemiological methods

## OMOP CDM

The OMOP CDM is a system of

- **tables**
- conventions, and
- vocabularies

that allow observational health data to be standardized.

It is this standard approach that facilitaties rapid innovation in the areas of open-source development, methods research and evidence generation.

<https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/index.html>

## Tables

The OMOP CDM is a **person-centric** model

![](figures/person_centric.png){width=50%}

## Tables

A typical patient journey within a healthcare system

## Tables {.scrollable}

A typical patient journey within a healthcare system **into data**

::: {.column width=100%}

![](figures/cdm_person.png)
::::

All clinical event tables are linked to the `PERSON` table.  Adding the date or start-date to events allows for a longitudinal view on all relevant events by person.

- Exception: standardized health system data tables

## Simple data model

![](figures/simple_data_model.png)

## Schemas and data tables {.scrollable}

Database schema separate between read-only and read-write tables

* CDM
  - Clinical event tables
  - Vocabulary tables

* Results

  - `COHORT` (basis of analysis)
  - `COHORT_DEFINITION`
  
The CDM is platform-independent.  Data types are basic ANSI SQL 

- `VARCHAR`, `BIGINT`, `INTEGER`, `FLOAT`, `DATE`, `DATETIME`, `CLOB`

## Events of different nature organize into domains

Events are stored in `domain-specific` tables and represented by `standard concepts`

- Condition domain
  - signs, symptoms, diagnoses
  - `CONDITION_OCCURRENCE` table

- Drug domain
  - `DRUG_EXPOSURE` table

## Semantic representation through concepts {.scrollable}

Each record is fully **normalized** through concepts

- Unique `CONCEPT_ID` values (foreign keys to `CONCEPT` table)

All CDM instances use the *same* `CONCEPT` table as a reference 

- Chief mechanism of interoperability

If a standard concept does not exist (or cannot be identified) `CONCEPT_ID` = 0

## Normalization in pictures

![](figures/normalization_keys.png){width=100%}

- Importance becomes (even more) obvious across data sources (language, coding systems)

## Field name conventions {.scrollable .smaller}

|Notation|Description|
|:------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------|
|[Event]_ID|Unique identifier for each record, which serves as a foreign keys establishing relationships across Event tables. For example, PERSON_ID uniquely identifies each individual. VISIT_OCCURRENCE_ID uniquely identifies a Visit.|
|[Event]_CONCEPT_ID|Foreign key to a Standard Concept record in the CONCEPT reference table. This is the main representation of the Event, serving as the primary basis for all standardized analytics. For example, CONDITION_CONCEPT_ID = [31967](http://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/31967) contains the reference value for the SNOMED concept of "Nausea".|
|[Event]_SOURCE _CONCEPT_ID|Foreign key to a record in the CONCEPT reference table. This Concept is the equivalent of the Source Value (below), and it may happen to be a Standard Concept, at which point it would be identical to the [Event]_CONCEPT_ID, or another non-standard concept. For example, CONDITION_SOURCE_CONCEPT_ID = [45431665](http://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/45431665) denotes the concept of "Nausea" in the Read terminology, and the analogous CONDITION_CONCEPT_ID is the Standard SNOMED-CT Concept [31967](http://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/31967). The use of Source Concepts for standard analytics applications is discouraged since only Standard Concepts represent the semantic content of an Event in a unambiguous way and therefore Source Concepts are not interoperable.|
|[Event]_TYPE_CONCEPT_ID|Foreign key to a record in the CONCEPT reference table, representing the origin of the source information, standardized within the Standardized Vocabularies. Note that despite the field name this is not a type of an Event, or type of a Concept, but declares the capture mechanism that created this record. For example, DRUG_TYPE_CONCEPT_ID discriminates if a Drug record was derived from a dispensing Event in the pharmacy ("Pharmacy dispensing") or from an e-prescribing application ("Prescription written")|
|[Event]_SOURCE_VALUE|Verbatim code or free text string reflecting how this Event was represented in the source data. Its use is discouraged for standard analytics applications, as these Source Values are not harmonized across data sources. For example, CONDITION_SOURCE_VALUE might contain a record of "78702", corresponding to ICD-9 code 787.02 written in a notation omitting the dot.|

## Database constraints

- `NOT NULL`: must have a value

- `UNIQUE KEY`: value must only exist once in table

- `PRIMARY KEY`: `NOT NULL` + `UNIQUE KEY`

- `FOREIGN KEY`: must have a value in a parent table / field

- `CHECK`: must check out (e.g. is positive)

## OMOP CDM

The OMOP CDM is a system of

- tables
- **conventions**, and
- vocabularies

that allow observational health data to be standardized.

It is this standard approach that facilitaties rapid innovation in the areas of open-source development, methods research and evidence generation.

## Vocabularies relate ideas (concepts)

![](figures/vocab_relationships)

A semantic concept is a concept that is represented in a network of interconnected concepts

## Mapping to OMOP standardized vocabularies {.scrollable}

::: {.column width="100%"}

![](figures/source_to_standard.png)

:::

What is standardized:

- `[TABLE]_CONCEPT_ID`: standard concept to which the source code maps, **used for analysis**

- `[TABLE]_SOURCE_CONCEPT_ID`: concept representation of the source code, **helps maintain tie to raw data**

- `[TABLE]_SOURCE_VALUE`: original source code as given in source table, **helps to review data quality**

Way to map a source code to standard code:

- `CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP` table

## How many concepts are in the OHDSI standard vocabularies? {.scrollable}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="30%"}
![](figures/all_vocabularies.png){width=100%}
:::
::: {.column width="70%"}
- 111 different vocabularies (like ICD-10, RxNorm)

- 78 are adopted from external sources (with differing licensing requirements)

## OMOP standardized vocabularies in a nutshell {.scrollable}

What they are:

- **Standardized structure** to house existing vocabularies used in the public domain
- **Compiled standards** from disparate public and private sources and some OMOP-grown concepts

What they are not:

- **Static dataset**: vocabularies update regularly to keep up with the continuous evolution of the sources
- **Finished product**: vocabulary maintenance and improvement is an ongoing activity that requires community participation and support
