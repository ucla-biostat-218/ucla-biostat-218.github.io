## HADES supporting packages

- `DatabaseConnector` + `SqlRender`: write code once, run on all supported platforms (SQL Server, Oracle, Postgres, RedShift, BigQuery, DataBricks, Snowflake)

- `Andromeda`: Work with data objects too big to fit in memory

- `ParallelLogger`: extensive logging to facilitate remote debugging

- `Cyclops`: fit **very large** regression models (logistic, Poisson, Cox)

- `DataQualityDashboard`: evaluate data quality

## HADES cohort packages

::: {.callout-important}
We define a cohort as a set of persons who satisfy one or more inclusion criteria for a duration of time. 
- Exposure cohorts (e.g. people exposed to warfarin)
- Outcome cohorts (e.g. people experiencing GI bleeding)
- Cohorts of special interest (e.g. pregnant persons)
:::

- `Capr`: define cohorts using complex logic

- `PhenotypeLibrary`: for storing OHDSI-approved cohort definitions

- `CirceR`: for turning cohort definitions into SQL or human-readable text

- `CohortGenerator`: for instantiating cohorts in a database

- `CohortDiagnostics` and `PheValuator`: for evaluating cohorts

## HADES analytic packages

- `Characterization`: characterizations of a target and a comparator cohort

- `CohortIncidence`: calculate incidence rates and proportions

- `PatientLevelPrediction`: develop and evaluate prediction models

- `CohortMethod` and `SelfControlledCaseSeries`: estimate causal effects

- `EmpiricalCalibration`: calibrate causal effect estimates based on negative controls

- `EvidenceSynthesis`: combine causal effect estimates across databases without sharing patient-level data.

::: {.callout-important}
## Research group focus
Causal effects at scale and (Bayesian) synthesis

## HADES organization

- Developer guidelines

- Code style guide

- Each package has 1 or 2 maintainers.

- Monthly meetings (3rd Thursday of the month, at 9am Pacific time)

- Discussions on forums, Teams channel, issue trackers

- Bi-weekly open-source community calls (Wednesdays, at 8am Pacific time)

## Continuous integration

At each push to GitHub:

- Run R Check on Windows, MacOS, and Linux

- Unit tests can use a set of database servers (SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Oracle, RedShift, Spark, \ldots)

- Compute code coverage

- If push to main branch and higher version in DESCRIPTION, create release

## HADES release process {.scrollable}

::: {.border}
![](figures/hades_process.png)
:::

Pros:

- Head of master is always latest released version:	
  * `remotes::install_github("ohdsi/Eunomia")`
  
- Git tag guaranteed to correspond to version in DESCRIPTION:
  * `remotes::install_github("ohdsi/Eunomia", ref="v1.0.0")`
  
- A release is guaranteed to pass all tests

- Prevents accidental installation of (buggy) develop version

Cons:

- Cannot use main for development

## CRAN

- Some HADES packages are in CRAN for easier install

- Getting things in CRAN is hard, because
  * Package size <7mb
  * Cannot use database testing servers, but also not allowed not to have running examples / unit tests.
  * CRAN requires code runs on really old platforms (e.g. Java 1.5, Solaris)

## HADES-wide release {.scrollable}

- HADES-wide release twice a year

- Currently available as `renv` lock file, hopefully as `docker` container starting next release

::: {.border}
![](figures/hades_release.png)
:::

::: {.callout-important}
`docker` often raises security concerns *inside* large organizations
:::

## `Strategus`

- Most people who would like to use HADES analytics do not know R

- `Strategus` aims to have analysis specs as input (JSON), and results as output (CSV files), with (Shiny) viewers for the output (after uploading to a database)

- Modular design: a study spec can list multiple modules, such as cohort generation + cohort method

- Move away from sharing code across the network to sharing study specs only (for security and ease of distribution)

::: {.callout-important}
## We will play with `Strategus` later on
:::

## Review (high-level)

- HADES is a suite of R packages for analyzing observational healthcare data

- Thanks to the OMOP CDM, HADES runs on a wide variety of data sources across the world

- Open source, to promote open science (all analytics code can be shared as part of publication)

- Supports federated networks, where data stay locally, and results are shared

## Review (low-level, unique features)

- Re-use of cohort definitions

- Standardization of analytics in open-source software
  * Many opportunities for testing, review, fixing bugs, etc.
  * Making it hard to do the wrong thing (opinionated)
  
- Advanced methods to reduce bias
  * Splines for time in self-controlled case series
  * Large-scale propensity scores in cohort method
  
- Objective study diagnostics to improve reliability of evidence
  * Including negative controls

- Designed to run across a network of databases
  * Without sharing patient-level data

## `Capr`: cohort definition application programming in R

A language for expressing OHDSI cohort definitions in R code

::: {.callout-important}
A cohort is a set of persons who satisfy one or more inclusion criteria for a duration of time

- One person may belong to multiple cohorts
- One person may belong to the same cohort for multiple different time periods
- One person may not belong to the same cohort multiple times during the same period of time
- A cohort may have zero or more members
:::

## Where `Capr` sits

![](figures/capr1.png)

## First exposure to lisinopril

![](figures/capr_anatomy.png)

Need to define:

- exposure to **lisinopril** (ingredient 1308216, [ATHENA](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/1308216))

- diagnosis of **hypertension** (SOMED condition 320128, [ATHENA](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/320128))

## Building concept sets

We want to include all drugs containing lisinopril (all **descendents** of lisinopril)

```{r c1}
#| echo: true
library(Capr)
lisinopril <- cs(descendants(1308216), name = "lisinopril")
lisinopril

hypertension <- cs(descendants(320128), name = "hypertension")
```

## Full cohort definition {.scrollable}

```{r c2}
#| echo: true
lisinoprilCohort <- cohort(
  entry = entry(
    drugExposure(lisinopril), # use `drug_exposure` table
    firstOccurrence()
  ),
  attrition = attrition(
    "365 days of prior observation" = withAll(
      continuousObservation(prior = 365) # use `observation_period` table
    ),
    "Prior hypertension" = withAll(
      atLeast(1, conditionOccurrence(hypertension), # use `condition_occurence` table
              duringInterval(eventStarts(-365, 0))
      )
    )
  ),
  exit = exit(
    endStrategy = drugExit(lisinopril,
                           persistenceWindow = 30,
                           surveillanceWindow = 0)
  )
)
```

![](figures/capr_exit.png)
:::

## Using `Capr` `CohortGenerator` and `CirceR` {.scrollable}

Here we will design a cohort of patients suffering from a gastroinstinal (GI) bleed and build the cohort table in `Eumonia`.

```{r c3}
#| echo: true
library(Capr)
library(CohortGenerator)
library(CirceR)
```

and connect to the database

```{r c4}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
library(DatabaseConnector)
# absolutePath <- file.path(getwd(), "data")
# Sys.setenv(EUNOMIA_DATA_FOLDER=absolutePath)
# absoluteFileName <- file.path(getwd(), "data", "GiBleed_5.3.sqlite")
# connectionDetails <-
# Eunomia::getEunomiaConnectionDetails(
# databaseFile = absoluteFileName
# )

giBleed <- cs(descendants(192671), name = "GI bleed")
as.json(giBleed)

# Can retrieve info from CDM if wanted
absoluteFileName <- file.path(getwd(), "data", "synthetic.duckdb")
connection <- connect(dbms = "duckdb", server = absoluteFileName)
giBleed <- getConceptSetDetails(giBleed, connection, "main")
disconnect(connection)

as.json(giBleed)
```

## Create a simple `Capr` cohort

Patients enter cohort when a concept in concept set occurs in `condition_occurrence` table

```{r c5}
#| echo: true
giBleed <- cs(descendants(192671), name = "GI bleed")
giBleedCohort <- cohort(
  entry = entry(conditionOccurrence(giBleed))
)
```

By default, patients exit cohort at the end of their observation period

## Create more complex cohorts {.scrollable}

We want two cohorts with inclusion rules and exit criteria

- No prior exposure to NSAIDS

- Exit at end of exposure, allowing 30-days btw RXs

```{r}
#| echo: true
# Concept sets:
celecoxibConceptId <- 1118084
diclofenacConceptId <- 1124300
nsaids <- cs(
  descendants(c(celecoxibConceptId, diclofenacConceptId)), 
  name = "NSAIDS"
)
celecoxib <- cs(
  descendants(celecoxibConceptId),
  name = "Celecoxib"
)
diclofenac  <- cs(
  descendants(diclofenacConceptId),
  name = "Diclofenac"
)

# Inclusion criterion:
attrition = attrition(
  "No prior NSAID exposure" = withAll(
    exactly(0, drugExposure(nsaids), duringInterval(eventStarts(-Inf, 1)))
  )
)

# Cohorts:
celecoxibCohort <- cohort(
  entry = entry(
    drugExposure(celecoxib, firstOccurrence()),
    observationWindow = continuousObservation(priorDays = 365)
  ),
  attrition = attrition,
  exit = exit(endStrategy = drugExit(celecoxib,
                                     persistenceWindow = 30,
                                     surveillanceWindow = 0))
)
diclofenacCohort <- cohort(
  entry = entry(
    drugExposure(diclofenac, firstOccurrence()),
    observationWindow = continuousObservation(priorDays = 365)
  ),
  attrition = attrition,
  exit = exit(endStrategy = drugExit(diclofenac,
                                     persistenceWindow = 30,
                                     surveillanceWindow = 0))
)
```

## Print-friendly {.scrollable}

We can generate human-readable output of any cohort definition using the `CirceR` package

```{r}
#| echo: true
rmarkdown <- CirceR::cohortPrintFriendly(toCirce(celecoxibCohort))
writeLines(rmarkdown)
```

::: {.callout-important}
NB: missing concept set definitions.  Better version is coming. 

- See: [LEGEND-T2DM function](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohdsi-studies/LegendT2dm/master/R/PrettyOutput.R)
:::

We can also use `CirceR` to generate SQL, but `CohortGenerator` does much more.

## Generate the cohorts {.scrollable}

`CohortGenerator` builds, manages and instantiates **cohort sets** (groups of cohort definitions)

```{r}
#| echo: true
cohortsToCreate <- makeCohortSet(giBleedCohort, 
                                 celecoxibCohort, 
                                 diclofenacCohort)

cohortsToCreate
```

## Generate the cohorts {.scrollable}

```{r}
#| echo: true
# Create the cohort tables to hold the cohort generation results
cohortTableNames <- CohortGenerator::getCohortTableNames(
  cohortTable = "my_cohort_table")
cohortTableNames

# Better to pass connection details than connection itself
connectionDetails <- DatabaseConnector::createConnectionDetails(
  dbms = "duckdb", 
  server = file.path(getwd(), "data", "synthetic.duckdb")
)
connectionDetails <- Eunomia::getEunomiaConnectionDetails()

CohortGenerator::createCohortTables(
  connectionDetails = connectionDetails,
  cohortDatabaseSchema = "main",
  cohortTableNames = cohortTableNames)

# Generate the cohorts
cohortsGenerated <- CohortGenerator::generateCohortSet(
  connectionDetails = connectionDetails,
  cdmDatabaseSchema = "main",
  cohortDatabaseSchema = "main",
  cohortTableNames = cohortTableNames,
  cohortDefinitionSet = cohortsToCreate)

# Get raw counts
CohortGenerator::getCohortCounts(
  connectionDetails = connectionDetails,
  cohortDatabaseSchema = "main",
  cohortTable = cohortTableNames$cohortTable
)
```

## Review

- [ATLAS](https://atlas-demo.ohdsi.org) is a web-based GUI for designing cohorts
  * interacts directly with a CDM; has record counts
  
- `Capr` is programmable in R
  * more reproducible; convenient for generating multiple related cohorts

::: {.callout-important}
## Now we will start to **use** these cohorts
