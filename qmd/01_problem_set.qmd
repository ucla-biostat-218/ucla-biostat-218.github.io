## OMOP CDM

1. John is an African American man born on August 4, 1974.  Define an entry in the `PERSON` table that encodes this information.

2. John enrolled in his current insurance on January 1st, 2015. The data from his insurance database were extracted on July 1st, 2019. Define an entry in the `OBSERVATION_PERIOD` table that encodes this information.

3. John was prescribed a 30-day supply of Ibuprofen 200 MG Oral tablets (NDC code: 76168009520) on May 1st, 2019. Define an entry in the `DRUG_EXPOSURE` table that encodes this information.

4. Using SQL and R, retrieve all records of the condition "Gastrointestinal hemorrhage" (with concept ID [192671](http://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/192671)) from the `Eunomia` dataset.

5. Using SQL and R, retrieve all records of the condition "Gastrointestinal hemorrhage" using source codes. This database uses ICD-10, and the relevant ICD-10 code is "K92.2" from the `Eunomia` dataset.

6. Using SQL and R, retrieve the observation period of the person with `PERSON_ID` 61 from the `Eunomia dataset.

## Standardize vocabularies

7. What is the standard concept ID for "Gastrointestinal hemorrhage"?

8. Which ICD-10CM codes map to the standard concept for "Gastrointestinal hemorrhage"? Which ICD-9CM codes map to this Standard Concept?

## Advanced SQL

9. What is the minimum, maximum, and mean length (in days) of observation from the `synthetic` dataset? (Hint: you can use the `DATEDIFF` function to compute the time between two dates.)

10. How many people have at least one prescription of celecoxib from the `Eunomia` dataset? (Note: thereâ€™s an easy way to do this, using `DRUG_ERA`, and a harder way using `DRUG_EXPOSURE` and `CONCEPT_ANCESTOR`. Can you do both?)

<!-- 11. During which period in time (calender start and end date) did people start a celecoxib prescription from the `synthetic` dataset? -->
