## Introduction

In these lectures we will learn about:

-   Prediction modeling

-   Differences with casual inference

-   Standardizing prediction via the `PatientLevelPrediction` package

## `PatientLevelPrediction` package {.scrollable}

::: border
![](figures/prediction.png){width="70%" fig-align="center"}
:::

Build a model to predict who in the target (T) cohort will the have (enter) the outcome (O) cohort

-   Uses all observed data up to T-start-date
-   Implements many machine learning / deep learning algorithms

::: callout-tip
## Example

Of persons initiating GLP1RAs, can we predict who will experience diarrhea?

-   T: GLP1RA exposure, restricted to those with T2DM (and first use only)
-   O: Diarrhea
:::

## Prediction problem statement {.scrollable}

::: border
![](figures/prediction2.png){width="80%" fig-align="center"}
:::

-   Among a target (T) cohort, we aim to predict which patients at a defined moment in time ($t = 0$) will experience some outcome (O) during a time-at-risk.

-   Prediction is done using **only** information about the patients in an observation window prior to that moment in time

## Key input to a prediction study {.scrollable}

We extract data from the persons in target (T) cohorts, of which some will experience the outcome (O)

::: {.border}
![](figures/t_o.png){fig-align="center" width=30%}
:::

Key input (must specify)

- Target (T) cohort 
- Outcome (O) cohort 
- Time-at-risk 
- Model specification

  * algorithm
  * hyperparameters

## Types of prediction questions in healthcare

::: r-stretch
![](figures/prediction_question.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

## Difference between explanatory and predictive models

Researchers build prediction models and make causal claims. This is not correct!

![](figures/why.png){width="40%" fig-align="center"}

## Some definitions {.scrollable}

-   Explanatory model: data generative (statistical) model (often) for testing hypothesis
-   Explanatory power: strength of relationship in statistical model
-   Predictive model: empirical model / algorithm for predicting new observations
-   Predictive power: ability to accurately predict new observations

::: {.callout-note}
One can empirically evaluate the predictive power of an explanatory model, but one cannot empirically evaluate the explanatory power of a predictive model

The best explanatory model is not necessariy the best predictive model

One does not have to understand the underlying causes in order to predict well!

[Shmueli, To explain or to predict? 2010](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/157/Papers/shmueli.pdf)

## Why should we avoid the term "risk factor?"

**Risk factor** is an ambiguous term

A predictive model is not selecting features based on their explanatory power, but is using **association** to improve **predictive** accuracy

::: callout-important
## Other use-cases

-   If the goal is search for causal factors, then use a population-level (causal) effect framework

-   If the goal is to search for association of individual features, then use clinical characterization
:::

We should avoid using the term "risk factor" and use the term "predictors" to make explicit that we are assessing **predictive** value

## Why is predictive modeling still valuable?

-   In healthcare, the question "what is going to happen to me?" is often more relevant than "why?"

-   Knowing if something is predictable or not based on the available data is valuable on its own

## Current state of predictive modeling

-   Inadequate internal validation
-   Small sets of features
-   Incomplete dissemination of model
-   Almost no transportability assessment (external validation)

::: callout-important
## Consequence

Surprisingly few predictive models are used in clinical practice

## Standardized models and evaluation

![](figures/plp_standard1_crop.png){fig-align="center" width="90%"}
:::

**Problem pre-specification**: a study protocol should  unambiguously pre-specify the planned analysis

**Transparency**: Others should be able to reproduce the study in every detail using the provided information.  All analysis code should be made available as open-source software (e.g. on the [OHDSI-Studies github](https://github.com/ohdsi-studies))

Target (T) and outcome (O) cohorts should be defined reproducibly and using standardized concepts

Standardized data extraction using [FeatureExtraction](https://ohdsi.github.io/FeatureExtraction)

- This allows for a (reproducible) specification of the candidate predictors and their time-windows

## Reminder

A covariate (like a cohort) is **not** just a concept set; it has time component (relative to T index-date)

* Person-split: individuals are assigned randomly to the trait or test sets, or
* Time-split: a split is made at a moment in time (*temporal validation*)

## Model selection is an empirical process

The **No Free Lunch theorem** states that there is not one model that works best for every problem.  The assumptions of a great model for one problem may not hold for another problem.

It is common in machine learning to try multiple models and find one that works best for a particular problem.

What makes a good model?

**Discrimination**: differentiates between those with and without the outcome event, i.e. predicts higher probabilities for those with the event compared to those who do not experience the event

**Calibration**: estimated probabilities are close to their observed frequencies

## How to assess discrimination? {.scrollable}

Suppose our classifier is *simply* BMI $> x$ for some outcome (O)

Both outome classes (blue = no O; red = yes O) have their own probability distribution of BMI

So, the choice of cutoff $x$ then determines how **sensitive** or **specific** our (very simple) algorithm is

![](figures/plp_outcomes.png)
:::
::: {#second-column}
![](figures/plp_confusion_matrix.png)
Confusion matrix
:::
::::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Definitions

- **TN**: true negative (from blue)
- **FN**: false negative (from red)
- **TP**: true positive (from red)
- **FP**: false positive (from blue)
:::

- True positive rate (TPR) = TP / (TP + FN)  -- sensitivity
- False positive rate (FPR) = FP / (FP + TN) -- $1 -$ specificity

::: {.callout-important}
## We extract these values from the **confusion matrix**

:::
:::
::::

- Plot TPR and FPR for **all possible** values of cutoff $x$

- Area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a popular measure of discrimination

::: {.callout-tip}
## Mathematically
AUC = probability that an individual with outcome (O) scores higher than an individual without O
:::

## Calibration

- Agreement between observed and predicted risk (probability)

- We want a model that has good calibration across the range of predictions (not just **on average**)

- A model is well calibrated if, say, for every 100 individuals given a risk of $p$% close to $p$ of them have the event. 

- For example, if we predict a 12% risk that an atrial fibrillation patient will have a stroke within 365 days, the observed proportion should be approx. 12 strokes per 100 patients

**Dissemination** of study results should follow the minimum requirements as stated in the [Transparent Reporting of a multivariate prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25560730/)

- Internal and external validation
- Sharing for full model details
- Sharing of all analysis code to allow full reproducibility
