:::

## Sadly I do not own a Delorean {.scrollable}

- What is our *next* best approximation?

- Randomized trial

- Instead of studying the same population under both decision options, let’s define a larger population and **randomly assign** one treatment to each person, then compare outcomes between the two cohorts $\ldots$

## Randomized trial {.scrollable}

:::

## Randomized trial outcomes {.scrollable}

::: {.border}
![](figures/random_outcomes.png){width=30% fig-align="center"}
:::

- Randomization implies (an **assumption**) that persons assigned to the target (T) cohort are **exchangeable at baseline** with persons assigned the comparator (C) cohort

::: {.callout-important}
Assumption is often weakly violated in finite trials
:::

## Sadly we cannot randomize in observational data

- What is our *next, next* best approximation?

::: {.callout-note}
## Observational study

- Comparative cohort designs: between persons who made different choices
  
Or

- Self-controlled designs: within persons during time periods with different exposure status

:::
  
## What is a confounder?

::: {.border}
![](figures/confounding3.png){width=70% fig-align="center"}
:::

- A factor that *simultaneously* drives **treatment assignment** and **outcome**

## Design an observational study like a randomized trial {.scrollable}

::: {.border}
![](figures/target_trial_masthead.png){width=50% fig-align="center"}

:::

::: {.callout-important}
## Much older idea
William Cochran / Gertrude Cox, 1950, *Experimental Design*
:::

Protocol components to emulate:

- Eligibility criteria
- Treatment strategies
- Assignment procedure
- Follow-up period
- Outcome
- Casual contracts of interest
- Analysis plan

:::

## Placebo-controlled randomized trials are hard to emulate {.scrollable}

New-user cohort method compares

- one target (T) treatment vs one comparator (C) treatment

::: {.callout-important}
## Very difficult  to compare against *no* treatment
:::

Hard to define a group of unexposed persons that are **comparable** to the exposed group

- Just ask yourself: when was I "not exposed"?  yesterday? the day before?

::: {.callout-note}
## Solution
Select comparator (C) for the **same** indication as T, where C is believed to have no effect on outcome (O)

- good for safety
- harder for effectiveness
:::

## Propensity score introduction {.scrollable}

- Propensity score (PS) = probability $P(A = \text{T} | X = x_i)$ of belonging to the target (T) cohort vs the comparator (C) cohort given baseline covariates (before assignment) $x_i$ for person $i$
  * [Rosenbaum and Rubins, 1983](https://academic.oup.com/biomet/article/70/1/41/240879): > 40,000 citations

- Propensity scores can be used as **balancing scores**: if the two cohorts have similar propensity score distributions, then the distribution of covariates should be similar (need to perform diagnostic to check)

::: {.callout-tip}
## PS modeling
- **Prediction** problem
- Plenty of machine learning approaches available
  * CART, random forests, SVMs, KNN, XGBoost, deep learning
  * logistic regression (regularized)
:::

## Proposity score intuition {.scrollable}

::: {.border}
![](figures/schneeweiss_ps.png){width=80% fig-align="center"}
:::

[Glynn, Schneeweiss and Sturmer, 2006](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16611199/)

## A little theory {.scrollable}

Propensity scoring controls for **measured** confounding.

If treatment assigment is *strongly ignorable* given measured characteristics, then propensity scoring  yields unbiased estimates of causal effects.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Strongly ignorable
- There are no unmeasured confounders
- Measured confounders are adjusted for appropriately
:::

I believe these are **not testable** assumptions

## Large-scale propensity scores {.scrollable}

- Traditional: select a handful of variables to use as predictors of treatment assignment (gender, age, a couple comorbidities)

- Standardized OHDSI approach: use all data prior to treatment assignment

::: {.callout-important}

Fully automated, except we must manually remove target and comparator concepts from the covariates!

- the very things we are trying to predict
:::

Only practical at OHDSI-scale via [Cyclops](http://ohdsi.github.io/Cyclops)

- To be discussed (I hope) later in course

## Confounding adjustment using propensity scores 

::: {.r-stretch}
![](figures/garbe_table.png){fig-align="center"}
::: 

[Garbe et al, 2013](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22763756)

## Confounding adjustment using propensity scores {.scrollable}

- Regression adjustment: not generally recommended
- Matching: OHDSI implemented
- Stratification: OHDSI implemented
- IPW: OHDSI implemented; [empirical evidence](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33367288/) that this does not work well 

::: {.callout-note}
## Different adjustments lead to subtly different casual estimands
Interesting, but beyond the scope of this course (ATT, ATE, etc)
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Garbe et al's hd-PS $\neq$ LSPS

## Matching to adjust for baseline covariate imbalance

::: {.r-stretch}
![](figures/matching_outcomes.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

## Stratification to adjust for basline covariate imbalance

::: {.r-stretch}
![](figures/stratification_outcomes.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

## Practical issues {.scrollable}

Exact matching (of continuous PSs) is rarely possible

Use some tolerance called a "caliper"

- Default: 0.2 on the logit-scale: [Austin, 2011](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20925139/)

**Preference score** ($F$) - scale: [Walker, 2013](https://www.dovepress.com/a-tool-for-assessing-the-feasibility-of-comparative-effectiveness-rese-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-CER)

- Adjusts for the "market share" of the two treatments

$$
\text{logit}(F) = \text{logit}(PS) - \text{logit}(\phi)
$$
where $\phi$ is the proportion of persons receiving the target treatment 

::: {.callout-note}
## Example
If 10% of patients receive the target treatment, then patients with a $F = 0.5$ have a 10% probability of receiving the target treatment
:::

## Covariate balance {.scrollable}

PS adjustment aims to make the target (T) and comparator (C) cohorts **comparable** (balanced)

::: {.border}
![](figures/balance_book.png){width=50% fig-align="center"}
:::

Rule of thumb: after-adjustment standardized difference of means $< 0.1$ [Rubin, 2001](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1020363010465)

::: {.callout-note}
Recent work shows that chance imbalance (smaller sample sizes) often violates $0.1$ cutoff

:::

## Standardized difference of means (SDM) {.scrollable}

::: {.border}
![](figures/lsps_demo.png)
:::

- Not adjusted for in manual approach
  * paracetamol users are less likely to have a diagnosis of pain recorded in their data
  * paracetamol users are more likely to be on cough suppressants or opiods

![](figures/outcome_models.png){width=70% fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.callout-important}
## Outcome regressors

- Usually with a single variable (treatment-effect)
- Sometimes with (large-scale) multivariable adjustment
  * also possible for Cox (and Fine-Grey) models: [Mittal et al, 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24096388/)  [Yang et al, 2024](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10618600.2023.2213279)
:::

## Objective diagnostics {.scrollable}

Residual **systematic error** remains pervasive 

- Whether study results are reliable depends on whether certain assumptions have been met
  * e.g. we assume our PS adjustment makes our treatment groups comparable
  
- Most of these assumptions are testable through diagnostics
  * e.g. we can test whether our PS adjustment achieved balance by computing the standardized difference of means (SDM)
  
- By **objective** diagnostics we mean diagnostics that are evaluated while blinded to the results of the study
  * e.g. pre-specify that we will not look at results where max(|SDM|) > 0.1
  * using negative controls

::: {.callout-important}
## Unique feature of HADES

- Only (arguably) possible through standardization $\rightarrow$ large-scale, repeatable
  * Many T/C pairs
  * Many **outcomes** (O) $\ldots$ including **negative control outcomes**

:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Findings are less impressive 
in comparison to the negative control estimates
:::

## Negative controls in a comparative cohort study {.scrollable}

- If neither target nor comparator causes the outcome, the hazard ratio / incidence rate ratio / odds ratio should be 1
  <!-- * a diagnostic could measure distance from ground truth, or -->
  <!-- * we could **calibrate** estimates to retain nominal operating characteristics, e.g. Type 1 Error rate -->

- Select 50-100 negative control outcomes per study

- ATLAS can help, using information ([common evidence model](https://github.com/OHDSI/CommonEvidenceModel)) from
  * Product labels
  * Scientific literature
  * Spontaneous reporting

## GenAI opportunity
- LLMs to parse multiple data source to expand CEM
:::

## How to interpret negative control findings?

- Idea: use a sample ($N > 50$) of negative controls to understand distribution of bias

- **Systematic error distribution** can be used as
  * *Diagnostic*: if too much systematic error, we stop
  * *Calibration*: can adjust $p$-values and confidence intervals to take into account possible systematic error
  
::: {.callout-important}
## Course plan
